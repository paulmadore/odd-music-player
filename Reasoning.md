# Reasoning

(Synopsis) The Odd Music Player, or OMP as it will come to be known, will be a simple yet powerful implementation of an open-source music player. It will aim to compete with iTunes directly for userbase, but be funded only by donations and free-time contributions from coders worldwide.

## Why Odd?

There is a certain type of music junkie who never wants to have to tell the music player what to do. They want to have a huge music library and have the player never get into a boring algorithm where it manages to play the same song twice in an 8 hour period, or even the same artist in some case. 

This user wants the software to do odd things that existing software does not. While existing implementations of music software have done a great job in some respects, they have failed in others, and seem to be low priority to developers with much larger fish to fry. 

## How Odd!

OMP will have good marketing and design at its core. It will not resemble previous music applications in most ways, and it will be slicker, faster, and yet more fully functioning.
